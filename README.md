# Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback. To submit the project, send a pull request to the original repository.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

Add all code to your project repository, including shell scripts, R analyses, python, etc.

Do not commit large data files to the repository. Provide paths to where they can be downloaded if they
are from public sources, or track them with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. This project will explore the genetic differences between the Papionins.

## The goal

The specific problem I sought to explore was the amount of molecular divergence between Papionins. I want to quantify to rate of molecular change between these genera.

## The data

Description of data...

- The data will be drawn from published genomic data on GenBank.
- Data structure: Nucleotide sequences

## Background
What the reader needs to know to understand the project
The subtribe Papionina within the Old World Monkeys includes the mangabeys and the “baboons,” which includes baboons proper, mandrills and drills, and geladas. The phylogenetic relationships of these taxa are relatively unresolved, especially with the recent discovery of the kipunji, a newly described mangabey that was designated a new genus, Rugwecebus. The current combined molecular and morphological phylogenies agree with the placement of Cercocebus (the semi-terrestrial mangabey) as the sister taxon to Mandrillus, but are uncertain about the relationships of Lophocebus (the arboral mangabey), Papio, Theropithecus, and Rugwecebus.


Motivation for the project....
It seems unusual for there to be so much uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships, especially in such a familiar mammalian order such as Primates and with all of the advances in molecular phylogenies in the recent decades. It would be interesting to explore the genetic difference between these taxa, which might help reveal their evolutionary relationships.
How it fits in with other work...


## Methods
Compare frequency of nucleotide changes
Try to quantify differences in the rates of these changes
